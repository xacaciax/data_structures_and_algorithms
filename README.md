# JS Data Structures and Algorithms 

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms that are typically used in software engineering interviews. The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized resource for engineers who are preparing for interviews or who want to brush up on their knowledge of these concepts.

## Data Structures

| Data Structure | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Arrays         | O(1) access, O(n) search/insert/delete | O(n) |
| Linked Lists   | O(n) access, search/insert/delete | O(n) |
| Stacks         | O(1) push/pop/peek | O(n) |
| Queues         | O(1) enqueue, dequeue/peek | O(n) |
| Trees          | O(log n) search/insert/delete | O(n) |
| Heaps          | O(log n) insert/delete, O(1) get min/max | O(n) |
| Graphs         | O(|V| + |E|) search/insert/delete | O(|V| + |E|) |
| Hash Tables    | O(1) average case, O(n) worst case search/insert/delete | O(n) |

The time and space complexity listed are generally for the worst-case scenario and may vary depending on the implementation.

## Algorithms

| Algorithm       | Time Complexity |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Bubble Sort     | O(n^2)         |
| Selection Sort  | O(n^2)         |
| Insertion Sort  | O(n^2)         |
| Merge Sort      | O(n log n)     |
| Quick Sort      | O(n log n)     |
| Binary Search   | O(log n)       |
| Breadth-First Search (BFS) | O(|V| + |E|) |
| Depth-First Search (DFS)   | O(|V| + |E|) |

The time complexity listed is generally for the worst-case scenario and may vary depending on the implementation.

## How to Use

To use this repository, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own file and includes comments explaining the implementation and time/space complexity. You can use these files as a reference or practice implementing the data structures and algorithms yourself.
